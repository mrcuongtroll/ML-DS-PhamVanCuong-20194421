# Session 3
This package provides my solution for Multi-layer Perceptron exercise.

## Prerequisite
The necessary data for this exercise is generated after running `TF-IDF.py` in session 1.

## Running instruction

Simply run `MLP.py`.

Running `MLP.py` will save the model's parameters in saved_params folder for future use.
