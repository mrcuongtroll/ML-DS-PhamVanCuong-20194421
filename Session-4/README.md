# Session 4
This package provides my solution for Word-2-Vec exercise using recurrent neural network.

## Prerequisite
The necessary data for this exercise is stored in datasets folder.

## Running instruction

1. Run `w2v_preprocessing.py`. It will generate encoded data and store in datasets/w2v folder.
2. Run `w2v_RNN.py`.

Using tensorflow-gpu with a decent GPU card is recommended if you don't want to turn your computer into a toaster.
Or you can try importing the code and data included in this repository on Google Colab and the and run it smoothly even with a potato-powered PC.
