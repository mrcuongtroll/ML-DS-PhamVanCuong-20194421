# Session 2
This package provides my solution for K-means exercises.

## Prerequisite
The necessary data for this session is generated by running `TF-IDF.py` in session 1.

## Running instruction
Run `Kmeans.py` (not using Sklearn) or `Using_Sklearn.py` (using Sklearn obviously).

If the prerequisite are met, the program should run without any problem.
